# Shiny Tool: Chain Fishing

This is a small tool to keep track of chained fishing encounters in Pokémon games, and to see your current odds during a chain.

Press the Hook button when you hook a Pokémon. If your chain breaks, hit Reset.

# **Planned features:**

- Add ways to see the possible encounters for the current location and game you're chaining in
- Add a section on the side to show a random tip picked from a pool
